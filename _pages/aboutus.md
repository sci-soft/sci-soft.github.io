**Public Journal Club** is a digital platform for the scientific discussion of recently published work in a "Journal Club" format.  Our work is focused in providing with an open forum for communication between science enthusiasts without regard to race, age, gender, sexual orientation, academic background, physical appearance or any other human characteristic than generates diversity. This way we look forward to address the need that biological sciences students have around the world, especially from developing countries which have limited forums for the analysis, discussion, and interpretation of scientific data.
